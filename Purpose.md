# Purpose
This project aims to provide a streamlined chat interface powered by the Ollama model system. The front end is built purely with HTML, and the backend is handled by a single Python file, server.py, which interfaces directly with the Ollama model. The goal is to offer users a simple, efficient chat experience without the complexity of a graphical user interface.
